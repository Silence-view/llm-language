# llm-language

**A scientifically-grounded prompt meta-compiler for Claude Code**

> Automatic prompt re-engineering through multi-agent debate, grounded in 100+ prompt engineering papers, specialized for Claude Opus 4.6 with ultrathink.

---

## Overview

`llm-language` is a [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) plugin that intercepts every user message and re-engineers it through a multi-agent Generate-Critique-Revise pipeline before execution. The system produces an optimized XML-structured prompt that is ephemeral (never saved to disk) and executed with maximum reasoning depth.

The pipeline implements a **Diverse Multi-Agent Debate** (DMAD) architecture where a Producer agent generates an optimized prompt and an independent Critic agent evaluates it against a 7-dimension scoring rubric. If the score falls below 8.5/10, the prompt is revised and re-evaluated, up to 2 rounds.

**v2.0** introduces **ROSETTA.md** — a persistent episodic memory file that evolves after every interaction, capturing what works for each specific user. Agents now have access to **all user skills**, **web deep research**, and can **ask the user for clarification** when uncertain.

### Key Features

- **ROSETTA.md persistent memory**: self-evolving user profile that improves output quality over time
- **Automatic interception** of every user message (skippable with "skip llm-language")
- **Multi-agent debate**: Producer (generator) + Critic (evaluator) with heterogeneous roles
- **Deep web research**: agents autonomously research unfamiliar domains before generating prompts
- **Full skill access**: agents can use ALL installed skills, tools, and capabilities
- **User clarification**: when uncertain, agents ask targeted questions instead of guessing
- **Scientific grounding**: 20+ techniques from 110+ papers mapped to task types
- **7-dimension scoring rubric**: includes User-Fit Alignment dimension powered by ROSETTA
- **XML-structured output**: leverages Claude's native XML parsing capabilities
- **Complexity-adaptive**: scales pipeline depth (simple=1 agent, critical=4 agents)
- **Ephemeral prompts**: generated XML lives only in conversation context
- **Opus 4.6 optimized**: ultrathink activation, extended context exploitation

```

### ROSETTA.md — Persistent Memory

ROSETTA.md (`~/.claude/ROSETTA.md`) is a self-evolving document that captures what works for each specific user. It is:

- **Read at the start** of every pipeline invocation (Phase 0)
- **Updated silently** after every execution (Phase 6)
- **Passed to all agents** as `<rosetta-context>` for personalized prompt generation
- **Scored by the Critic** via Dimension 7 (User-Fit Alignment)
- **Consolidated automatically** when approaching 300 lines (merges similar patterns, removes outdated entries)

After 10+ interactions, the system noticeably adapts to the user's preferences, communication style, and typical task patterns. Inspired by PersonalLLM (ICLR 2025), PromptWizard (Microsoft 2024), and Reflective Memory Management research.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI installed
- Claude Opus 4.6 model access

### Method 1: Install via Marketplace (recommended)

This registers the GitHub repository as a Claude Code marketplace, making it installable with a single command.

```bash
# Step 1: Add the GitHub repository as a marketplace source
claude plugins marketplace add https://github.com/Silence-view/llm-language

# Step 2: Install the plugin globally (user scope = works in any directory)
claude plugins install llm-language@llm-language --scope user

# Step 3: Verify installation
claude plugins list
# Expected output:
#   llm-language@llm-language
#   Version: 1.0.0
#   Scope: user
#   Status: enabled
```

To update to a newer version later:
```bash
claude plugins install llm-language@llm-language --scope user
```

To uninstall:
```bash
claude plugins uninstall llm-language@llm-language
claude plugins marketplace remove llm-language
```

### Method 2: Install from Local Clone

If you want to modify the skill or develop locally:

```bash
# Step 1: Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Silence-view/llm-language.git ~/.claude/plugins/local/llm-language

# Step 2: Register the local folder as a marketplace
claude plugins marketplace add ~/.claude/plugins/local/llm-language

# Step 3: Install at user scope
claude plugins install llm-language@llm-language --scope user

# Step 4: Verify
claude plugins list
```

With a local clone, any changes you make to the skill files take effect immediately.

### Method 3: Install as Standalone Skill (minimal)

If you don't need the full plugin infrastructure:

```bash
# Copy just the skill directory
git clone https://github.com/Silence-view/llm-language.git /tmp/sl-temp
cp -r /tmp/sl-temp/skills/llm-language ~/.claude/skills/llm-language
rm -rf /tmp/sl-temp
```

> **Note:** Standalone skills only work when Claude Code loads the `~/.claude/skills/` directory. The plugin method (Methods 1-2) is more reliable and works globally.

## Usage

### Automatic Mode (default)

Once installed, the skill triggers automatically on every user message. You'll see a summary banner before each response:

```
★ llm-language ──────────────────────────────
Applied: CoT + Self-Refine | Role: Senior Backend Engineer
Complexity: moderate | Sub-tasks: 3 | Thinking: ultrathink
Score: 8.7/10 | Rounds: 1
Skills matched: paper, humanizer
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

### Manual Invocation

```
/llm-language
```

### Skip for a Message

Include "skip llm-language" or "raw mode" in your message to bypass the pipeline.

### Key Findings Informing Design

1. **General instructions outperform prescriptive steps** in extended thinking mode (Anthropic, 2026). The Producer generates high-level methodology rather than step-by-step plans.

2. **DMAD consistently outperforms standard MAD** (Liang et al., 2024). We use heterogeneous roles (Producer vs Critic) rather than identical debaters.

3. **Role prompting improves style/format but not factual accuracy** (Meincke et al., 2025; multiple studies). The `<role>` field is used for output alignment, not knowledge claims.

4. **XML reduces hallucination** in structured outputs (Xu et al., 2025; Anthropic, 2025). The entire prompt is XML-structured.

5. **Score inflation is a known failure mode** in multi-agent evaluation (Smit et al., 2024). The rubric uses anti-inflation rules: start at 7, require evidence for every score.

6. **Personalized models provide maximal benefits as interactions accumulate** (PersonalLLM, ICLR 2025). ROSETTA.md enables this by persisting preference signals across sessions.

7. **Self-evolving feedback loops achieve superior performance across 45 tasks** (PromptWizard, Microsoft 2024). Our Generate-Critique-Revise cycle with ROSETTA persistence extends this pattern.

8. **Human feedback integration improves multi-step task performance by 10-29%** (PROMST, EMNLP 2024). The user clarification mechanism in Phase 1.4 implements this.

## Decision Matrix

Used in Phase 1.4 to select appropriate scientific techniques:

| Task Type | Primary Technique | Secondary | Thinking Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| Simple factual | Direct instruction | -- | quick/default |
| Multi-step reasoning | CoT | Self-Consistency | extended |
| Ambiguous/creative | ToT | DMAD | ultrathink |
| Code generation | Decomposition | Self-Refine | extended |
| Architecture/design | ToT + Decomposition | Reflexion | ultrathink |
| Analysis/research | CoT + Retrieval-Aug | Calibration | ultrathink |
| Writing/editing | Role + Self-Refine | Few-shot | extended |
| Debugging | Reflexion + CoT | Adversarial | extended |
| Complex multi-part | Least-to-Most + DecomP | Meta-Prompting | ultrathink |
